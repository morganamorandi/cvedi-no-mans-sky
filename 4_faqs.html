          <button class="accordion">How can I find an item I have lost in the Nexus?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>
              If you lost one of your items you can go to Lost&Found Office. You can find the directions for the
              Lost&Found Office in the Map & Directions section.<br>
              When a lost item is found, it is handed over to the airport's Lost&Found Office and you'll receive an
              e-mail
              asking you to confirm that the item found is yours
              and start the process of shipping it by courier or picking it up at the airport. It may take 2 days to 1
              week between the time the item is found and the time you
              receive the notification.<br>
              The collection can be done by making an appointment through the Call Center or sending a e-mail as
              instructed in the discovery confirmation.<br>
              In the event of collection by a proxy, the following documents must be presented/send:
            </p>
            <ul class="accordion-ul">
              <li class="accordion-li">
                a proxy for collection stating the name of the delegated person;
              </li>
              <li class="accordion-li">
                a photocopy of your ID;
              </li>
              <li class="accordion-li">

            <p>
              If you wish to receive your item through shipping you'll have to fill in the shipment form. The item will
              be
              sent by the chosen courier to the postal address
              provided and the shipping cost will be calculated based on the destination.
